# The Wonderful Git Integration Demo

The Git Integration Tool lets you use a third-party versioning system to manage Terminalfour assets. This lets teams work on Page and Content Layouts as well as Media Items in the editor of their choice using a technology of their choice. So, if you create your stylesheet with Sass and then compile it to CSS you could set up a workflow that pushes the compiled CSS to a Git repository which is then deployed to your Terminalfour instance - automatically.

## How does it work?

### What you need
- A Git Repository. We support GitHub (Cloud) and Bitbucket (Cloud)
- A Terminalfour Test instance. You'll need Terminalfour â‰¥ 8.3.4 to use the Token Authentication methods.
